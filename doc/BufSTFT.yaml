digest: Perform a Short-Time Fourier Transform on one channel of a buffer
sc-categries: FluidCorpusManipulation
sc-related: Classes/Buffer
see-also:
description: |
  Performs either a forward or inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on a single channel source |buffer|. In the forward case, resulting magnitudes and phases can be written to output buffers. In the inverse case, these buffers can be used to reconstruct the original source into a new buffer.

  The magntude and phase buffers are laid out as (number of hops, number of bins). The number of hops is a function of the source length and the hop size. The number of bins is (1 + (fft size / 2)).

  The object is restricted to analysing a single source channel, because the channel counts of the magntude and phase buffers would quickly get out of hand otherwise.

parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to use for the forward STFT
  startFrame:
     description: |
      The starting point for analysis in the source (in samples)
  numFrames:
     description: |
      The duration (in samples) to analyse
  startChan:
     description: |
      The channel to analyse
  magnitude:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to write magnitudes to in the forward case, or read from in the inverse case. This is optional for the forward transform, mandatory for the inverse.
  phase:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to write phases to in the forward case, or read from in the inverse case. This is optional for the forward transform, mandatory for the inverse.
  resynthesis:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to write re-synthesised data to in the inverse case. Ignored for the forward transform. Mandatory in the inverse case.
  inverse:
    description: |
      When set to 1, an inverse STFT is performed, and the resynthesised data is written to the resynthesis buffer using overlap-add.
  windowSize:
    description: |
      The number of source samples that are analysed at once.
  hopSize:
    description: |
       How many samples there are in-between analysis windows. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
       The FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision. The -1 default value will use the next power of 2 equal or above the windowSize. For this object it is effectively capped at 65536.
