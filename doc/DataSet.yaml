description: |
  A server-side container associating labels with multi-dimensional data. FluidDataSet is identified by its name.

parameters:
  name:
    description: |
      A symbol with the name of the DataSet. ​
messages:
  addPoint:
   description: |
      Add a new point to the data set. The dimensionality of the DataSet is governed by the size of the first point added. Will report an error if the label already exists, or if the size of the data does not match the dimensionality of the DataSet.
   args:
    - name: label
      description: |
        A symbol or string with the label for the new point.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| with the new data point.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added. ​​
  updatePoint:
   description: |
      Update an existing label's data. Will report an error if the label doesn't exist, or if the size of the data does not match the given dimensionality of the DataSet.
   args:
  getPoint:
   description: |
      Retrieve a point from the data set into a |buffer|. Will report an error if the label or buffer doesn't exist​.
   args:
  deletePoint:
   description: |
      Remove a point from the data set. Will report an error if the label doesn't exist. ​​
   args:
  setPoint:
   description: |
    Set the point: if the label exists, this method behaves like updatePoint; if the label doesn't exist, behaves like addPoint.
  clear:
   description: |
      Empty the data set. ​
   args:
  merge:
   description: |
      Merge sourceDataSet in the current DataSet. It will update the value of points with the same label if overwrite is set to 1. ​To add columns instead, see the 'transformJoin' method of FluidDataSetQuery.
   args:
     - name: sourceDataSet
       description: |
         The source DataSet to be merged.
     - name: overwrite
       description: |
         A flag to allow overwrite points with the same label.
     - name: action
       description: |
         A function to run when the merge has happened. ​​
  free:
   description: |
      Destroy the object on the server.
   args:
  print:
   description: |
      Post an abbreviated content of the DataSet in the window by default, but you can supply a custom action instead. ​​
   args:
  synth:
   description: |
      The internal synth the object uses to communicate with the server
   args:
  server:
   description: |
      The server instance the object uses ​
