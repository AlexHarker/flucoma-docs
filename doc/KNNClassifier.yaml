description: |
  A nearest-neighbor classifier using :fluid-obj:`FluidKDTree` . Each point is assigned the class that is most common among its nearest neighbors. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#classification

parameters:
  numNeighbours:
    description: |
      the number of neighours to consider
  weight:
    description: |
      true / false: whether the neighbours should be weighted by distance
messages: 
  fit:
   description: |
      Fit the model to a source :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` and a target :fluid-obj:`FluidLabelSet`. These need to be the same size
   args:
    - name: dataset
      description: |
        Source data
    - name: labelset
      description: |
        Labels for the source data
    - name: action
      description: |
        Run when done
  predict:
   description: |
      Given a fitted model, predict labels for a :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` and write these to a :fluid-obj:`FluidLabelSet`
   args:
    - name: dataset
      description: |
        data to predict labels for
    - name: labelset
      description: |
        place to write labels
    - name: action
      description: |
        Run when done
  predictPoint:
   description: |
      Given a fitted model, predict labels for a data point in a |buffer| and return these to the caller
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A data point
    - name: action
      description: |
        Run when done, passes predicted label as argument
