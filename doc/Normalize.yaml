description: |
  Normalize the entries of a :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet`, or normalize a data point according to the learned bounds of a data set. On the server.

  See http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part2/section-16.html

parameters:
  min:
    description: |
      Minimum output value, default 0
  max:
    description: |
      Maximum output value, default 1
  invert:
    description: |
      The direction in which the normalization will occur for transform and transformpoint. The default 0 is taking in the range of the input used to fit and transforms it towards the normalised range. A value of 1 will expect an input of the normalized range to transform back to the original range.
