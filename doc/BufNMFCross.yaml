  Produces hybridisations of two |buffer|s by using Nonnegative Maxtrix Factorization (NMF)

  See Driedger, J., Prätzlich, T., & Müller, M. (2015). Let it Bee-Towards NMF-Inspired Audio Mosaicing. ISMIR, 350–356. http://ismir2015.uma.es/articles/13_Paper.pdf

  The process works by attempting to reconstruct the `target` sound using the timbre of the `source` sound, resulting in a hybrid whose character depends on how well the target can be represnted by the source's spectral frames.

  In contrast to :fluid-obj:`BufNMF`, the size and content of the bases dictionary are fixed in this application to be the spectrogram of the `source`. Each spectral frame of `source` is a template: be aware that NMF is O(N^2) in the number of templates, so longer `source` buffers will take dramatically longer to process.

parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      A |buffer| whose content will supply the spectral bases used in the hybrid
  target:
    description: |
      A |buffer| whose content will supply the temporal activations used in the hybrid
  output:
    description: |
      A |buffer| to contain the new sound
  timeSparsity:
    description: |
      Control the repetition of source templates in the reconstruction by specifying a number of frames within which a template should not be re-used. Units are spectral frames.
  polyphony:
    description: |
      Control the spectral density of the output sound by restricting the number of simultaneous templates that can be used. Units are spectral bins.
  iterations:
    description: |
      How many iterations of NMF to run
  windowSize:
    description: |
      The analysis window size in samples
  hopSize:
    description: |
      The analysus hop size in samples (default winSize / 2)
  fftSize:
    description: |
      The analsyis FFT size in samples (default = winSize)
