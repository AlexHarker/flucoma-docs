      The input to be processed
  gain:

      Audio or control rate change of the gain.
output: Same as input, multiplied by the gain factor.

  	Summing with the inverse (gain of -1) gives us CPU-expensive silence.
  CODE::
  { var source = PinkNoise.ar(0.1); source + FluidGain.ar(source,-1); }.play
  ::
  Varying the gain at audio rate.
  CODE::
  { FluidGain.ar(PinkNoise.ar(0.1), gain:LFTri.ar(1)) }.play
  ::
  Varying the gain at comtrol rate, in beautiful stereo.
  CODE::
  { FluidGain.ar(SinOsc.ar([222,333],mul:0.1), gain:LFTri.kr([0.5,0.7])) }.play
