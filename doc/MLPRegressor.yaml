  Perform regression between :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet`s using a Multilayer Perception neural network.

parameters:
  hidden:
    description: |
      An `Classes/Array` that gives the sizes of any hidden layers in the network (default is two hidden layers of three units each).
  activation:
    description: |
      Ativation function to use for the hidden layer units.
  maxIter:
    description: |
      Maximum number of iterations to use in training.
  learnRate:
    description: |
      The learning rate of the network. Start small, increase slowly.
  momentum:
    description: |
      Training momentum, default 0.9
  batchSize:
    description: |
      Training batch size.

      description: |
        Layer whose output to return.
    - name: action
      description: |
        Function to run when complete
  predictPoint:
   description: |
      Apply the learned mapping to a single data point in a |buffer|
   args:
    - name: sourceBuffer
      description: |
        Input point
    - name: targetBuffer
      description: |
        Output point
